  This is a website for a local acupuncture practice that's opening this month. It was built with HTML, CSS and a bit of jQuery. 
  This experience was very different from building projects for General Assembly. Not having creative agency and being tasked with turning someone else's vision into a real website were new types of challenges. Although code-wise this was not my most challenging or exciting project, learning about some of the other obstacles that come up in this line of work was an invaluable experience. 
  If I were to do this project again, I would have used Bootstrap. It would have made the responsiveness less time consuming, and would have made my code more DRY. I also learned about the limits of chrome devtools. For instance, on the iPhone X simulator, the website looks perfect. But on a real iPhone X, it does not.
