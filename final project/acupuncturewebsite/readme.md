  This is a website for a local acupuncture practice that's opening this month. It was built with HTML, CSS and a bit of jQuery. 
  This experience was very different from building projects for General Assembly. Not having creative agency and being tasked with turning someone else's vision into a real website were new types of challenges. Although code-wise this was not my most challenging or exciting project, learning about some of the other obstacles that come up in this line of work was an invaluable experience. 
  My biggest struggle was making it responsive accross devices--phones, computers, and tablets. I learned that using the chrome DevTools device emulator is not the most accurate basis for responsive design.
